\subsection{Architectures}

For the purpose of our experiments, we leverage a U-Net network (cite https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf). U-Net is a fully convolution neural network used extensively for image segmentation. It involves encoder and decoder components connected with skip connections. For the classification model that serves as our encoder and extracts features of different spatial resolution, we use a ResNet architecture (cite https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf). As part of our ablation study, we also review a U-Net++ network (cite https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10165.pdf) which consists of convolution layers on skip pathways.
% ----------------------------------------

% ----------------------------------------
\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
% ----------------------------------------
 The lead evaluation metric for us is the Jaccard Index, also known as Intersection over Union (IoU).
\begin{equation*}
    IoU=\frac{target \cap prediction}{target \cup prediction}
\end{equation*}

In addition to IoU, we also capture Pixel Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. High pixel accuracy (the number of pixels classified correctly) doesn't always imply good segmentation results, especially in cases of class imbalance. This is true in our case since the 'woodland' class dominates all other classes.

% ============================
\section{Setup and Experiments}
% ============================

\subsection{Setup}
Our entire data augmentation, training, and prediction pipeline is implemented on the PyTorch framework (cite) and we use the NVIDIA V100 GPU (cite) to speed up our computations. The SMP library (cite) provides us segmentation models with pre-trained backbones. 
\\
\\Typically, neural network initialized with weights from a pre-trained network shows better performance and for our purposes, we initialize our ResNet encoder with ImageNet (cite) weights. The encoder depth is kept at a constant value of 5 throughout the scope of our experiments. 

\subsection{Hyperparameters}
Our seed dataset is divided into train-validation-test with a ratio of 80:10:10. A batch size of 32 works best for our use-case and we keep this value constant throughout. The Adam optimizer is our choice for all our experiments as it helps us converge faster and we apply a softmax activation after the final convolution layer. A bit of fine-tuning helps us arrive at a starting learning rate of $1\text{e-}4$ for our StepLR with a multiplicative factor of 0.1 every 15 epochs. Finally, the choice for our loss function is the Focal Loss as it helps us address class imbalance. We do consider other loss functions (Cross Entropy Loss and Dice Loss) and we discuss this in detail in the next section.
\subsection{Experiments}
We conduct a variety of experiments across multiple configurations of our pipeline and we discuss them in detail.

\subsubsection{Dataset Challenges}
Datasets in their raw form pose a serious challenge due to multiple factors. For instance, the Ghana Dataset (cite) comprises of low-res images, class imbalance, and high cloud cover. On the other hand, the LandCoverNet dataset excels in terms of image quality and adequate labels for each class, but it comes up short when it comes to cloud cover. Figure 1 illustrates the results of one such experiment we conduct on this dataset.

\subsubsection{Loss Functions} As part of this study, we do a comparative analysis of three loss functions - Focal, Dice, and Cross Entropy. We plug a ResNet18 encoder (with pre-trained ImageNet weights) in our U-Net network. Training is done for a total of 40 epochs. Fig 1 shows the predicted masks when we oversample the woodland representation (on an already unbalanced dataset).

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{no-roads-loss/2-images.png}
    \caption{Prediction on a highly-imbalanced dataset with a U-Net network on a ResNet18 encoder. The first column contains the actual images, the second column represents the target mask, the third, fourth, and fifth columns represent the predicted mask with Dice, Focal, and Cross Entropy Loss respectively. Dice Loss(third columns) fails to detect the minority class (roads) in a lot of samples}
\end{figure*}

Fig. 2 shows the predicted masks on our actual dataset. Fig 3 and Fig 4 depict the progression of IoU and F-Scores respectively over the training iterations.
\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{roads-losses/with-roads.png}
    \caption{Prediction on a more balanced dataset with a U-Net network on a ResNet18 encoder. The first column contains the actual images, the second column represents the target mask, the third, fourth, and fitth columns represent the Predicted Mask with Dice, Focal, and Cross Entropy Loss respectively}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure}[!hb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=80mm, scale=2.5]{roads-losses/three-losses-iou.png}
    \caption{Progression of IoU Scores over 40 epochs for Focal Loss (Magenta), Dice Loss (Teal), and Cross Entropy Loss (Gray). U-Net network having a ResNet18 encoder pre-trained with ImageNet weights. The dataset doesn't have an imbalance. }
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Number of Layers in the Encoder} The intent of this experiment is to observe the effect of the depth of a net work. ResNet18, Resnet35, and Resnet50 are our encoder choices and we start with pre-trained ImageNet weights. Focal Loss measures the difference between the actual values and our estimated values. We train for a total of 50 epochs and the results are shown in Fig10 and IoU progression is shown in Fig11.

\subsubsection{U-Net vs U-Net++} We now replace our original U-Net network with U-Net++. We use ResNet34 as our encoder with pre-trained ImageNet weights. Again, Focal Loss is our choice for the loss function and we train for a total of 50 epochs. 


% ============================
\section{Results}
% ============================
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Focal Loss performs the best in scenarios of data imbalance. On the other hand, IoU values remain comparable between the three loss functions when the dataset is slightly balanced.
    \item ResNet50 performs best vs 18 and 34
    \item U-Net++ provides a better.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\section{Introduction}
\hl{This is the start of the IEEE template. We can delete everything after here} \\
This document is a model and instructions for \LaTeX.
Please observe the conference page limits. 

\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
